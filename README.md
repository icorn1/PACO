# PACO
Repositori de l'assignatura PACO, Paralelisme i Concurr√®ncia (UPC - EPSEVG)

This subject focuses on paralelism of threads. This is achieved by using the "omp" library in C programs. In the repository there is no code, there's only the solutions to given LAB assignments. In those LABs we were asked to use "tareador" or (mostly) "#pragma omp" to solve paralelism problems.
